# Console-Based-Tic-Tac-Toe-game
This is a console based two player tic-tac-toe game which has been designed in C++.
The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3 Ã— 3 grid. The game is played by two players, who take turns. The first player marks moves with a '1', the second with a '2'. The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of three marks wins. This program draws the game board, asks the user for the coordinates (row#, col#) of the next mark, changes the players after every successful move, and pronounces the winner.
